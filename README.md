## :star: Overview

*Auto-Tune is a Minecraft plugin that allows you to create an automated economy for your server. Prices of items will be automatically adjusted based on supply and demand. When an item is purchased by many players but sold by few, Auto-Tune will raise the price to lower demand/increase supply and vice versa. Auto-Tune fixes a critical problem in Minecraft server economies and provides a better experience for players and servers. You can check out our feature set below.*

## :question: Why use Auto-Tune

Auto-Tune identifies and fixes a significant problem in Minecraft servers that has remained underdeveloped and ignored for too long. This issue is the poor implementation of an economy and markets into Minecraft.

Previous solutions that allow for trading between players have lacked flexibility, player engagement, and realism. These issues are due to server economy plugins that cannot adapt to the speed at which the economy in Minecraft changes. We designed Auto-Tune with this in mind. By automating the price-setting process, server admins can sit back and watch the prices fluctuate as the supply and demand of items bounce back and forth.

Not only does this assist administrators in managing a server's economy, but it also allows the server players to engage with the economy more rigorously. We have strenuously tested Auto-Tune to be fit for any environment and created systems designed to assist server admins in building the best economy possible for the specific needs of their server. Auto-Tune is a powerful and highly customizable plugin that has a feature set rich enough to satisfy any server. We at Auto-Tune are passionate and optimistic about Minecraft plugin development and building a community that loves Minecraft and economics!
